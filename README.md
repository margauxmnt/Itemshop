# Project Description

Very simple web application that displays items fetched from an API and allows the user to add or remove them in a basket.

The main objective for me was to learn how to use the hook useContext instead of using Redux.

# Technos used

* [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-installation--page)
